# Motivation

While figuring out new ways to setup servers and various services, I realized that I was doing the same thing over and over again. I was deploying servers, setting up services, and configuring them in the same way. I thought that it would be a good idea to document the steps I was taking so that I could refer back to them later.

Here are some walkthroughs that I have begun to write down. I hope that they are helpful to you as well.
